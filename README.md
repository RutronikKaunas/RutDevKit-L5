**With the RUTDevKit-STM32L5 created by Rutronik, hardware and firmware developers get a "one-stop" platform solution for their own  development. The Kit only uses products from Rutronik's portfolio.**

The developer kit based on an ultra-low-power microcontroller  (STM32L562ZET6Q) running at 110MHz, 512kB Flash memory and 256kB SRAM. A secure boot process and TrustZone-based system isolation ensures  protected applications development.

Thanks to various power  supply options (battery/SMPS) as well as the integrated CAN FD and RS485 interfaces, in combination with external PSRAM or NOR flash memory, the RUTDevKit is particularly suitable for the development of applications  such as wearables and sensors.

The embedded ST-LINK V2  debugger/programmer as well as the ArduinoTM expansion connectors for  additional boards offers augmented usability and flexibility like IoT  applications.
